## Design System
- **Theme**: Dark mode with black backgrounds, neon cyan (#00FFFF) and magenta accents, pixel grid textures
- **Typography**: Animated typewriter text, glitch effects, neon glow text
- **3D**: React Three Fiber scenes on every page — floating geometries, particle fields, rotating objects
- **Navigation**: Fixed retro arcade-style navbar with neon borders, smooth page transitions

## Technical Approach
- **3D Engine**: React Three Fiber with @react-three/drei for 3D scenes on every page
- **Animations**: CSS keyframe animations, typewriter effects, glitch text, fade-ins, parallax scrolling
- **Dark Mode**: Default dark theme with neon cyan/magenta color palette
- **Contact Form**: Lovable Cloud edge function to handle form submissions
- **Routing**: React Router with animated page transitions
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive across desktop and mobile

## Build Strategy
Due to the scale (20+ pages with 3D), this will be built incrementally:
1. First: Design system, navigation, and 3D utilities
2. Then: Core pages (Hero, About, Tech Stack, Projects)
3. Then: Deep-dive project pages and philosophy pages
4. Finally: Contact form with backend, GitHub stats, and polish
